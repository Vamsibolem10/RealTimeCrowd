# Real-Time People Counting Using Deep Learning
AI-powered people counting system using YOLO and OpenCV for real-time crowd analytics.
Track, count, and analyse movement in dynamic environments with precision!

# Overview
Ever wondered how many people pass through a certain area in real time? This project combines deep learning and computer vision to detect and count people in videos using YOLO. Itâ€™s designed for applications like smart surveillance, retail analytics, and public safety monitoring.
ðŸ”¹ Tracks movement in real time
ðŸ”¹ Logs entry & exit timestamps
ðŸ”¹ Applies noise-reducing morphological processing
ðŸ”¹ Works with video datasets & live feeds

# Key Features
YOLO-powered detection â€“ Fast & accurate people tracking
Real-time processing â€“ No delay in counting
Morphological mask filtering â€“ Noise reduction for precise detection
Adaptable to different environments â€“ Works in various lighting conditions

# Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
